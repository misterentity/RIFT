# Port Flooding Test Tool Product Context

## Purpose
The Port Flooding Test Tool addresses the critical need for game developers to test their DDoS prevention mechanisms in a controlled, safe environment. By simulating various types of network traffic, developers can evaluate and improve their game servers' resilience to potential DDoS attacks.

## Problem Statement
Game servers are frequent targets of DDoS attacks, which can disrupt player experience and cause significant financial losses. Developers need a way to:
1. Test their DDoS prevention mechanisms
2. Simulate different types of network floods
3. Measure server response under load
4. Identify vulnerabilities before deployment
5. Validate protection measures

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users: Game Developers
- Easy configuration of test parameters
- Clear visibility of test progress
- Immediate control over testing
- Comprehensive feedback
- Safe testing environment

### Key User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to:
   - Test specific port ranges used by my game
   - Control the intensity of the test
   - Monitor the test in real-time
   - Stop the test immediately if needed
   - Get clear feedback about the test results

2. As a system administrator, I want to:
   - Validate DDoS protection measures
   - Test multiple protocols
   - Control resource usage
   - Monitor system impact
   - Ensure safe testing practices

## How It Should Work

### Interface Design
1. Clean, intuitive GUI layout
2. Logical grouping of related controls
3. Clear status indicators
4. Real-time log display
5. Responsive controls
